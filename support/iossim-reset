	#cyan[iOS Simulator reset needed.]

	Sorry, but we could not start the AppGyver Scanner in your iOS Simulator.

	We have launched the iOS Simulator without an application.  Now switch to
	the iOS Simulator, select #bold[iOS Simulator] from top menu bar, and then
	click on #bold[Reset Contents and Settings...].

  If you are unable to see the iOS Simulator, please run the #bold[simulator]
  command again. The iOS Simulator should launch, allowing you to reset it
  with the instructions above.

	After the iOS Simulator has reset, please run the #bold[simulator] command
  again, and the Steroids simulator app should launch.

	Sorry about the trouble, we're trying to find a better way to do this.
