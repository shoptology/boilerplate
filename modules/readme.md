# Shoptology NPM Packages

Trying something out here. If we were to move our standard boilerplate
items to node modules, what would they be?

I think the goal of most of these modules is to enforce a standard way for
us to do things to really quickly bootstrap a new project.
We wouldn't be designing for the average user out there. It's
tailored to our needs. There may be a few exceptions that we publish
on the main namespace of npm and allow issues and pull requests.

We now have a private npm registry at https://npm.goshoptology.com.
