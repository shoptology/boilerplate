## Installation and requirements

* Python 2.7 or greater ( http://www.python.org/getit/ )

#### OS X

* Python 2.7 or greater (preinstalled on OS X Lion and newer)

#### Linux

* Python 2.7 or greater

### Installing With Node Version Manager (for OS X and Linux)

We recommend installing with NVM, see [https://github.com/creationix/nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm): it allows you to run multiple versions of node and does not require sudo at any point.

    $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | sh

Note that by default NVM adds initialization lines to `.bash_profile`, so you need to make sure these lines are loaded.

To install node.js 0.10.x with nvm and set it as default:

    $ nvm install 0.10
    $ nvm use 0.10
    $ nvm alias default 0.10

Now install Steroids globally with the `-g` flag:

    $ npm install steroids -g

Note that some third-party npm packages might give warnings during the install project. These warnings shouldn't affect how the Steroids npm functions.

## Usage

    $ steroids create directory_name
    $ cd directory_name
    $ steroids connect

More usage information is available via

    $ steroids usage

That way, it will be much easier to review and merge each one contribution.

To develop Steroids-npm locally:

* Clone this repo and install its dependencies (`npm install`).
* Create a symlink from `/usr/local/bin/devroids` to your development Steroids executable.
* Use `devroids` as you would use `steroids`.
