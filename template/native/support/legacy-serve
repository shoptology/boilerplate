#red[Sorry]

You tried to launch serve with:

  $ steroids serve

We have changed that. Serve is now part of connect:

  $ steroids connect --serve [--servePort=<port>]

The reason for this change was that using serve without #bold[steroids make] (which #[steroids connect] runs internally) didn't make much sense.

Thanks,
